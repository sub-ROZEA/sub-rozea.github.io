This is my first post I guess. I'm trying out the static site generator [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/). It might be overkill depending on what I want to use this site for. 

My main reasons for using it:

- I don't want a bunch of duplicated code (headers)
- Seems to fit the use case of blogs.
- No client side JavaScript (JS)

The last one is the most important for me. This site doesn't need any client side JS. It's just pictures and text, I don't want users to have to load 3 pounds of JS just to see static text and images.

I used to use Tailwind for this site, but for a simple site like this I don't really see the point? It just adds another thing to learn to change anything. Which does using Eleventy make sense, I dunno yet.

Question is, how long will I keep this site up. Will I look back on this post many years from now? The markdown file should stand the test of time.

Until next time!
